Created by Aftermathic using Python.

YOU MUST HAVE PYTHON DOWNLOADED FOR THE BOT TO RUN!
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

To run the bot you need these libraries:

Discord.py 

Requests

OS

JSON

Random
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

If you don't have these, then put these commands in command prompt. (Pip installing JSON and OS will not work because they are mostly likely installed with Python.)

pip install discord.py

pip install requests

(I'm not sure if Random is installed with Python, but if the code doesn't work you might need to pip install Random.)

pip install random
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Once you have these downloaded, go inside the file and change the bot token to your own bot token so it runs on your bot.

Then run the file using command prompt with this command.

python Aftermathic2.py
